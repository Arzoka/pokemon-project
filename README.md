# Socketmon

<<<<<<< HEAD
Socketmon is a project that I created simply because I wanted to learn more about websockets, and I wanted to work with pokemon
formulas. The goal is to have a fully working multiplayer pokemon battle system.

## Current Features

- Pokeballs
- Providing an encounter
- Shiny system
- Stat system
- Pokemon catching system
- Movement system

## TODO

- Implement websockets
- Add more fun formulas
- Styling
- Store userdata in a database (unsure whether it'll be mongodb or mySQL)
